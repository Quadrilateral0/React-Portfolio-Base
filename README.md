# Amanda C. Dulaney - Portfolio
## Description
For this project, I created a portfolio page to function as a digital resume. This project is a work-in-progress and will be updated as my skills grow. This application demonstrates my skills with JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and responsive web design. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
